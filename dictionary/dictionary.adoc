= The Dictionary

Software architecture tends to suffer from underspecified terminology and, more generally, overuse of jargon.
Professionals should take care to use well-defined terms with written definitions when possible.
They might reference Wikipedia or industry sources; organizations and projects may also find it useful, or even necessary, to maintain dictionaries of their own.
These dictionaries might reiterate standard definitions or address variations and nuances specific to the context. In that spirit, this dictionary defines the software terms used throughout the Miscellany.

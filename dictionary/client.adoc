= Client

A _client_ is any link:element[] that sends a link:request[] directly to another element.
An element that listens to such requests is a link:server[].

Typically, that request is sent via some link:protocol[], such as HTTP, and will include a response from the server back to the client.
However, neither the request nor response need be sent synchronously; the terms define only the roles that the elements play relative to each other.
A client and server pair might also communicate, for example, by sending a request via a message queue.
Furthermore, a client can also be a server and, indeed, many servers are also clients of other servers.
